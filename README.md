## Wasteless is a web application that is part of the IT project: Intelligent energy resource management tool. 

  In this project, we retrieve our database which contains all the data related to the energy consumption per hour of several customers. We then try to extract as much information as possible that can help us predict the future consumption of each customer. In this perspective, we develop a Machine Learning model that will allow us to predict, as desired, the future consumption of the customers based on relevant information given by the database. Once this step was successful, it was time to present all this information and algorithms in a way that could be understood by any user in the user dashboard
